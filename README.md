KORG DW-6000: Data
==================

This project contains data including documents and sysex files. I used the official documentation as well as my [korg-dw-6000--program-editor](https://github.com/lbaran27/korg-dw-6000--program-editor) project to create all the data. It includes:

*   All original programs in sysex format.
*   A copy of the data in the "KORG DW-6000 Preload program list" document in pdf and xlsx format.

To download all the data, click on the following link: [main.zip](https://github.com/lbaran27/korg-dw-6000--data/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)

Musically,

Laurent
